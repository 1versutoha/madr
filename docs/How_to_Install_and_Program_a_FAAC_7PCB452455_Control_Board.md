## What You Need
 
Before you start, make sure you have the following items:
 
- A FAAC 7PCB452/455 control board (also known as 452 MPS or 455 D)
- A FAAC swing gate operator (such as 400, 412, 415, etc.)
- A power supply (230V or 115V AC)
- A differential thermal breaker
- Accessories such as photocells, push-buttons, keypads, etc.
- A screwdriver and a wire stripper
- A multimeter (optional)

## How to Install the Control Board
 
Follow these steps to install the control board:

1. Turn off the power supply and disconnect the gate operator from the mains.
2. Open the control board enclosure and remove the protective cover.
3. Mount the control board on the enclosure using the screws provided.
4. Connect the power supply wires to the terminal board J3 (see fig. 1 in the manual[^1^]). Make sure to respect the polarity and use a suitable cable section.
5. Connect the gate operator wires to the terminal board J4 (see fig. 2 in the manual[^1^]). Make sure to respect the motor rotation direction and use a suitable cable section.
6. Connect the accessories wires to the terminal board J1 (see fig. 2 in the manual[^1^]). Make sure to respect the function and polarity of each input and use a suitable cable section.
7. If you have opening and closing limit-switches or gatecoders, connect them to the terminal board J6 (see fig. 2 in the manual[^1^]). Make sure to respect the function and polarity of each input and use a suitable cable section.
8. If you have Minidec, Decoder or RP receivers, connect them to the connector J2 (see fig. 2 in the manual[^1^]). Make sure to respect the function and polarity of each pin.
9. Close the protective cover and the enclosure.
10. Turn on the power supply and check that the LED PWR on the control board is on.

## How to Program the Control Board
 
Follow these steps to program the control board:

1. To enter the programming mode, press and hold the button PRG on the control board for about 3 seconds until you hear a beep. The LED PRG will start flashing.
2. To select a parameter, press and release the button PRG until you reach the desired parameter number. The LED PRG will flash according to the parameter number (e.g. one flash for parameter 1, two flashes for parameter 2, etc.). You can also use a multimeter to read the parameter number on the test point TP1.
3. To change a parameter value, press and release the button CHG until you reach the desired value. The LED CHG will flash according to the value number (e.g. one flash for value 1, two flashes for value 2, etc.). You can also use a multimeter to read the value number on the test point TP2.
4. To confirm a parameter value, press and hold both buttons PRG and CHG for about 3 seconds until you hear a beep. The LED PRG will stop flashing and stay on.
5. To exit the programming mode, press and hold both buttons PRG and CHG for about 6 seconds until you hear two beeps. The LED PRG will turn off.
