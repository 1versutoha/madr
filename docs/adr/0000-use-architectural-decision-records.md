# Use Architectural Decision Records

We need to record the architectural decisions made in this project.

## Considered Alternatives

* No records
* [madr](https://github.com/adr/madr) - Markdown Architectural Decision Records
* [DecisionRecord](https://github.com/schubmat/DecisionCapture) - Agile records by [@schubmat](https://github.com/schubmat/)
* [Michael Nygard's template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) - The first incarnation of the term "ADR". Maintainable by [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
* [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) - The Y-Statements
* [Other templates](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record)

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen Alternative: madr
* That template is lean and fits most our development style
